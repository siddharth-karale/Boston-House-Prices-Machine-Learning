# Boston House Price Prediction Project

The Boston Housing Price dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. 
It is often used for regression analysis and predictive modelling. 
The dataset provides information about various factors that may influence the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston.

## Project Description

This project aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in the Boston area using machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

# Dataset Features:

The dataset contains 13 different input features (predictors) that can be used to make predictions. These features include:  

 1.	CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.    
 2.	ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.   
 3.	INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.  
 4.	CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).  
 5.	NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).  
 6.	RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.  
 7.	AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.  
 8.	DIS: Weighted distance to employment centres.  
 9.	RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.  
 10.	TAX: Property tax rate (in $1,000s).  
 11.	PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.  
 12.	B: Proportion of residents of African American descent.  
 13.	LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population.

## Target Variable:  

The target variable is:  

14.	MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1,000s.

## Methodology

* The project used the publicly available Boston housing dataset.
* ... (describe your data pre-processing)
* ... (explain your model selection process)
* ... (mention hyperparameter tuning if applicable)

## Models

* Implemented and evaluated various models, including ...
* The best performing model was ... (with results)

## Evaluation Metrics

* Evaluated models using R2 score and Mean Absolute Error(MAE) with value of 0.90 and 2.07 respectively. Plotted the graph of actual vs predicted prices.The graph shows a strong linear trend, indicating that the model makes consistent predictions across the range of observed prices.
